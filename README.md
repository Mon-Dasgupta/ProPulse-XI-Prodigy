# T20 World Cup 2022 Data Analytics Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for an end-to-end data analytics project focused on the T20 World Cup 2022. The project aims to build insights into creating the best possible 11-player team using data collected from ESPNcricinfo. The process involves web scraping, data transformation, cleaning in Pandas, and the creation of interactive dashboards in Microsoft Power BI.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the dataset obtained through web scraping and any additional datasets used in the analysis.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, transformation, and cleaning.
- **`dashboards/`**: Microsoft Power BI files for interactive data visualization.
- **`README.md`**: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Data Collection

The data for this project was collected from ESPNcricinfo using web scraping techniques. 
The raw data is available in the `data/` directory.

## Data Analysis & Transformation

The Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory outline the process of data preprocessing using 'Python', data analysis, transformation(using both Python and PowerBI Query Editor), and cleaning using Pandas. 

## Interactive Dashboards

The interactive dashboards were created using Microsoft Power BI and can be found in the `dashboards/` directory. These dashboards provide a visual representation of the insights derived from the data.

## Acknowledgments

This project makes use of the following open-source libraries and tools:

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): A powerful data manipulation library for Python.
- [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/): A business analytics service for interactive data visualization.
